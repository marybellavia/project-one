### Question One: What are the demographics for food deserts in Missouri by county?


### Question Two: What is the relationship between the poverty rate for a given county in Missouri and low access populations?

### Question Three: What is the food environment for the counties that comprise Missouri’s two largest cities, St. Louis and Kansas City?
After looking over the data, we decided to break the two largest cities in Missouri down into their 4 largest counties. We are now able to see what types of food environments make up the majority of each county and how this relates to the food desert. In our first bar chart, we compared total supermarkets to just standard fast food restaurants. As you can see, the amount of fast food restaurants nearly doubles the amount of supermarkets in every county. Our second bar chart, breaks down the percentage of convenience stores, fast food restaurants, full service restaurants, and supermarkets. This chart also showing that supermarkets makes up a small percentage of each county versus the percentages of fast food and full service restaurants. Although each county has plenty of food options available there is still a lack of supermarkets available based on our data provided. All the other options of fast food and full services restaurants aren't necessarily the healthiest of options, and individuals with lower income could have a difficult time purchasing food from these types of restaurants on regular basis.
