PROPOSAL
Topic: Resource Deserts and Public Transportation
Link to Dataset(s):
* Google Places API: https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/places/
* US Census Bureau API & Python Library: https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html 
* Google Transit API: https://developers.google.com/transit
Questions:
* Where do food deserts exist in Midwestern cities?
* Is there a relationship between zipcodes with food deserts and the poverty levels of those zipcodes?
* Is there a relationship between lack of public transportation and food deserts in Midwestern cities?

TO DO 12/14:
* Define what is a food desert?
* Define parameters for public transportation?
* Pick citites?

A few thoughts...
For example: what places are you going to query? what geographic areas will you query? 

12/14/2020
 - Found a dataset
    - We will need to understand and re-iterate what the dataset considers poverty rates and food desert for the presentation
 - FOR NEXT TIME:
    - import the CSV
    - filter the dataset down to state, possibly counties or census tracts
    - decide / look at the data variables to decide what to make graphs out of
